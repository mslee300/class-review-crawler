SUNY Cortland,HIS100,"The whole semester seemed like smoke on mirrors with him. There was never a set routine for class. It felt like he would come to class unprepared to teach. I had an A all the way through the semester until I took the final, I finished with a C-. The grading criteria for all assignments is very unclear and it takes him forever to grade everything.",Ukelina,"Jan 31st, 2023",5.0
